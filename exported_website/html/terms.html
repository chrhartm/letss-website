<h3><strong>Intellectual Property</strong></h3>
<p>The intellectual property in the materials in Letss and on our website are owned by or licensed to Letss B.V.. You may download Letss, to view, use, and display the application on your mobile device for your personal use only.</p>
<p>This constitutes the grant of a license, not a transfer of title. This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions or these Terms of Service, and may be terminated by Letss B.V. at any time.</p>
<h3><strong>User-Generated Content</strong></h3>
<p>You retain your intellectual property ownership rights over content you submit to us for publication within Letss and/or on its corresponding website. We will never claim ownership of your content, but we do require a license from you in order to use it.</p>
<p>When you use Letss or its associated services to post, upload, share, or otherwise transmit content covered by intellectual property rights, you grant to us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license to use, distribute, modify, run, copy, publicly display, translate, or otherwise create derivative works of your content in a manner that is consistent with your privacy preferences and our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>The license you grant us can be terminated at any time by deleting your content or account. However, to the extent that we (or our partners) have used your content in connection with commercial or sponsored content, the license will continue until the relevant commercial or post has been discontinued by us.</p>
<p>You give us permission to use your username and other identifying information associated with your account in a manner that is consistent with your privacy preferences, and our Privacy Policy.</p>
<h3><strong>Automatic Updates</strong></h3>
<p>You give us permission to download and install updates to Letss on your device in accordance with your privacy preferences. This permission can be revoked at any time by deleting Letss from your device.</p>
<h3><strong>Liability</strong></h3>
<p>Letss and the materials in Letss and on our website are provided on an 'as is' basis. To the extent permitted by law, Letss B.V. makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property, or other violation of rights.</p>
<p>In no event shall Letss B.V. or its suppliers be liable for any consequential loss suffered or incurred by you or any third party arising from the use or inability to use Letss, our website, or any other services provided by Letss B.V. or the materials in Letss, even if Letss B.V. or an authorized representative has been notified, orally or in writing, of the possibility of such damage.</p>
<p>In the context of this agreement, “consequential loss” includes any consequential loss, indirect loss, real or anticipated loss of profit, loss of benefit, loss of revenue, loss of business, loss of goodwill, loss of opportunity, loss of savings, loss of reputation, loss of use and/or loss or corruption of data, whether under statute, contract, equity, tort (including negligence), indemnity, or otherwise.</p>
<p>Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
<h3><strong>Accuracy of Materials</strong></h3>
<p>The materials appearing in Letss or on our website are not comprehensive and are for general information purposes only. To the extent permitted by law, Letss B.V. does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials in Letss or on our website, or otherwise relating to such materials or on any resources linked to Letss and our website.</p>
<h3><strong>Links</strong></h3>
<p>Letss B.V. has not reviewed all of the sites linked to Letss or on its corresponding website and is not responsible for the contents of any such linked site. The inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement, approval, or control by Letss B.V. of the site. Use of any such linked website is at your own risk and we strongly advise you make your own investigations with respect to the suitability of those sites.</p>

<p>To the extent that you are using or accessing Letss on an iOS device, you acknowledge and agree to the terms of this clause. You acknowledge that these Terms of Service are between you and Letss B.V. only, not with Apple Inc. (Apple), and Apple is not responsible for Letss and any materials available in Letss.</p>

<p>If Letss fails to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the purchase price of the mobile application to you.

<p>Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to Letss or your use of Letss, including but not limited to (1) product liability claims; (2) any claim that our mobile application fails to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (3) claims arising under consumer protection or similar legislation.</p>
<p>Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defence, settlement, and discharge of any third-party claim that our mobile application infringes that third party’s intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>You agree to comply with any applicable third-party terms when using Letss, including any Usage Rules set forth in the Apple App Store Agreement of Service.</p>
<p>Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms of Service, and upon your acceptance of these Terms of Service, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms of Service against you as a third-party beneficiary of these Terms of Service.</p>

<h3><strong>Severance</strong></h3>
