								<div class="content-text"><p>Your privacy is important to us. It is Letss B.V.'s policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including via our app, Letss, and its associated services.</p>
<p><br>Personal information is any information about you which can be used to identify you. This includes information about you as a person (such as name, address, and date of birth), your devices, payment details, and even information about how you use an app or online service.</p>
<p><br>In the event our app contains links to third-party sites and services, please be aware that those sites and services have their own privacy policies. After following a link to any third-party content, you should read their posted privacy policy information about how they collect and use personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of your activities after you leave our app.<br><br>This policy is effective as of 31 December 2021.<br><br>Last updated: 6 March 2022</p>
<h2><br>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Information we collect falls into one of two categories: “voluntarily provided” information and “automatically collected” information.</p>
<p>“Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide us when using our app and its associated services.</p>
<p>“Automatically collected” information refers to any information automatically sent by your device in the course of accessing our app and its associated services.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Log Data</h3>
<p>When you access our servers via our app, we may automatically log the standard data provided by your device. It may include your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your device type and version, your activity within the app, time and date, and other details about your usage.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you encounter certain errors while using the app, we automatically collect data about the error and the circumstances surrounding its occurrence. This data may include technical details about your device, what you were trying to do when the error happened, and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may not receive notice of such errors, even in the moment they occur, that they have occurred, or what the nature of the error is.</p>
<p>Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other data to personally identify individual persons.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Device Data</h3>
<p>Our app may access and collect data via your device's in-built tools, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your identity</li>
<li>Location data</li>
<li>Camera</li>
<li>Storage, photos and/or media</li>
<li>Notifications</li>
<li>Background data refresh</li>
</ul>
<p>When you install the app or use your device’s tools within the app, we request permission to access this information. The specific data we collect can depend on the individual settings of your device and the permissions you grant when you install and use the app.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>We may ask for personal information — for example, when you submit content to us or when you contact us — which may include one or more of the following:</p>

<li>Phone/mobile number</li>
<li>Gender identity</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Photographs</li>
<li>Login information for social media accounts linked to your Letss account</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sensitive Information</h3>
<p>“Sensitive information” or “special categories of data” is a subset of personal information that is given a higher level of protection. Examples of sensitive information include information relating to your racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion, trade union or other professional associations or memberships, philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation, sexual practices or sex life, criminal records, health information, or biometric information.</p>
<p>The types of sensitive information that we may collect about you include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexual orientation</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not collect sensitive information about you without first obtaining your consent, and we will only use or disclose your sensitive information as permitted, required, or authorized by law.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>User-Generated Content</h3>
<p>We consider “user-generated content” to be materials (text, image and/or video content) voluntarily supplied to us by our users for the purpose of publication on our platform, website or re-publishing on our social media channels. All user-generated content is associated with the account or email address used to submit the materials.</p>
<p>Please be aware that any content you submit for the purpose of publication will be public after posting (and subsequent review or vetting process). Once published, it may be accessible to third parties not covered under this privacy policy.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Legitimate Reasons for Processing Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>We only collect and use your personal information when we have a legitimate reason for doing so. In which instance, we only collect personal information that is reasonably necessary to provide our services to you.</p>

<li>for technical assessment, including to operate and improve our app, associated applications, and associated social media platforms</li>
</ul>
<p>We may combine voluntarily provided and automatically collected personal information with general information or research data we receive from other trusted sources. For example, If you consent to us accessing your social media profiles, we may combine information sourced from those profiles with information received from you directly to provide you with an enhanced experience of our app and services.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Security of Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.</p>
<p>Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security.</p>
<p>You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring the security of your own information within the bounds of our services.</p>
<p>For example, ensuring any passwords associated with accessing your personal information and accounts are secure and confidential.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy. For example, if you have provided us with personal information as part of creating an account with us, we may retain this information for the duration your account exists on our system. If your personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.</p>
<p>However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.</p>

<h2>Additional Disclosures for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Compliance (EU)</h2>
<h3>Data Controller / Data Processor</h3>
<p>The GDPR distinguishes between organisations that process personal information for their own purposes (known as “data controllers”) and organizations that process personal information on behalf of other organizations (known as “data processors”). We, Letss B.V., located at the address provided in our Contact Us section, are a Data Controller with respect to the personal information you provide to us.</p>
<h3>Legal Bases for Processing Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>We will only collect and use your personal information when we have a legal right to do so. In which case, we will collect and use your personal information lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner. If we seek your consent to process your personal information, and you are under 16 years of age, we will seek your parent or legal guardian’s consent to process your personal information for that specific purpose.</p>
<p>Our lawful bases depend on the services you use and how you use them. This means we only collect and use your information on the following grounds:</p>
<h3>Consent From You</h3>
<p>Where you give us consent to collect and use your personal information for a specific purpose. You may withdraw your consent at any time using the facilities we provide; however this will not affect any use of your information that has already taken place. You may consent to providing your email address for the purpose of receiving marketing emails from us. While you may unsubscribe at any time, we cannot recall any email we have already sent. If you have any further enquiries about how to withdraw your consent, please feel free to enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy.</p>
<h3>Performance of a Contract or Transaction</h3>
<p>Where you have entered into a contract or transaction with us, or in order to take preparatory steps prior to our entering into a contract or transaction with you. For example, we need technical information about your device in order to provide the essential features of our app.</p>
<h3>Our Legitimate Interests</h3>
<p>Where we assess it is necessary for our legitimate interests, such as for us to provide, operate, improve and communicate our services. For example, we collect technical information about your device in order to improve and personalize your experience of our app. We consider our legitimate interests to include research and development, understanding our audience, marketing and promoting our services, measures taken to operate our services efficiently, marketing analysis, and measures taken to protect our legal rights and interests.</p>
<h3>Compliance with Law</h3>
<p>In some cases, we may have a legal obligation to use or keep your personal information. Such cases may include (but are not limited to) court orders, criminal investigations, government requests, and regulatory obligations. If you have any further enquiries about how we retain personal information in order to comply with the law, please feel free to enquire using the details provided in the Contact Us section of this privacy policy.</p>
<h3>International Transfers Outside of the European Economic Area (EEA)</h3>
<p>We will ensure that any transfer of personal information from countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to countries outside the EEA will be protected by appropriate safeguards, for example by using standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission, or the use of binding corporate rules or other legally accepted means.</p>
<h3>Your Rights and Controlling Your Personal Information</h3>
<p><strong>Restrict: </strong>You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal information if (i) you are concerned about the accuracy of your personal information; (ii) you believe your personal information has been unlawfully processed; (iii) you need us to maintain the personal information solely for the purpose of a legal claim; or (iv) we are in the process of considering your objection in relation to processing on the basis of legitimate interests.</p>
<p><strong>Objecting to processing: </strong>You have the right to object to processing of your personal information that is based on our legitimate interests or public interest. If this is done, we must provide compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which overrides your interests, rights, and freedoms, in order to proceed with the processing of your personal information.</p>
<p><strong>Data portability: </strong>You may have the right to request a copy of the personal information we hold about you. Where possible, we will provide this information in CSV format or other easily readable machine format. You may also have the right to request that we transfer this personal information to a third party.</p>
<p><strong>Deletion:</strong> You may have a right to request that we delete the personal information we hold about you at any time, and we will take reasonable steps to delete your personal information from our current records. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will let you know how the deletion affects your use of our app, website or products and services. There may be exceptions to this right for specific legal reasons which, if applicable, we will set out for you in response to your request. If you terminate or delete your account, we will delete your personal information within 28 days of the deletion of your account. Please be aware that search engines and similar third parties may still retain copies of your personal information that has been made public at least once, like certain profile information and public comments, even after you have deleted the information from our services or deactivated your account.</p>
<h2>Additional Disclosures for California Compliance (US)</h2>

You may make this type of request once every calendar year. We will email you a list of categories of personal information we revealed to other organisations for their marketing purposes in the last calendar year, along with their names and addresses. Not all personal information shared in this way is covered by Section 1798.83 of the California Civil Code.</p>
<h3>Do Not Track</h3>

<p>We adhere to the standards outlined in this privacy policy, ensuring we collect and process personal information lawfully, fairly, transparently, and with legitimate, legal reasons for doing so.</p>
